2.2.3
reworked my registry system so it uses my registry classes instead of plain old hashmaps. This should reduce crashes as now instead of returning null, it returns empty or default classes in case no key is in the registry
unstable because this needs to be tested a bit to make sure everything works, but should increase stability in the long run.
2.2.2
renamed my code packages to include both my curseforge name and my mod name

should fix /restorelevel not working
fix crash on unknown stat. now it shouldn't crash anymore, but just give a warning, and only once

added item for clearing runes and runewords from an item
most spells have their cast speed increased
tweaked some code to be cleaner, could cause weird bugs

added an item that adds group affix to map
